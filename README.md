#### About 15-character GeoID
- Make sure that column G is formatted as text (to preserve leading zeros), not number
- Break down a sample GeoID: 090035245022001
  - state = 09
  - county = 003
  - tract = 524502 = 5245.02
  - block group = 2
  - block = 001

## How to insert script into any Google Sheet
  - Go to your Google Sheets > Tools > Script Editor
  - File > Create New Script File
  - Copy and paste contents of your preferred script (such as geocoder-census-google.gs)
  - Save as Code.gs (or save, then rename to geocoder-census-google.gs)
  - Refresh your Google Sheet and look for new Geocoder menu
